This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of Covid-19 data using various statistical and graphical techniques. The Covid-19 pandemic has created vast amounts of data, and this project aims to leverage this data to better understand the trends, impacts, and patterns associated with the pandemic.

By utilizing several visualization techniques such as Line Plots, Box Plots, Histograms, Violin Plots, Scatter Plots, Pair Plots, and Bar Plots, the project offers an in-depth exploration of the data. Each of these visualization methods allows for a comprehensive understanding of key metrics such as infection rates, recovery rates, and the overall progression of the pandemic across different regions and time periods.

Key Features:
Line Plots to visualize trends over time.
Box Plots to analyze the distribution of Covid-19 data and detect outliers.
Histograms to display the frequency distribution of various Covid-19 metrics.
Violin Plots to compare the distribution of the data across different categories.
Scatter Plots to examine the relationships between different variables.
Pair Plots to visualize correlations between multiple variables.
Bar Plots to compare data across different categories and regions.
Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Covid-19 pandemic by visualizing complex data patterns. The insights generated from this project can help inform public health decisions, aid in policy formulation, and assist in future research efforts related to the pandemic and other health crises.
